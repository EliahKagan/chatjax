ChatJax++
=========

ChatJax++ is a user script to enable MathJax in Stack Exchange chat.  It aims to be an easier, faster and more lightweight alternative to [RobJohn's ChatJax bookmarklets](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~robjohn/math/mathjax.html).

Some notable features of ChatJax++ include:

* As a user script, ChatJax++ runs automatically when you open chat.  There's no need to click a separate bookmark to turn on MathJax.
* ChatJax++ only runs in chat rooms belonging to [sites that use MathJax](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/216607).  Thus, you don't need to worry about text in other chat rooms getting messed up.  Also, text from other rooms shown in the sidebar will not be parsed for MathJax.
* ChatJax++ automatically loads the MathJax settings from the site the chat room belongs to.  Thus, for example, the *mhchem* extension is automatically enabled for the [Chemistry](http://chemistry.stackexchange.com) and [Biology](http://biology.stackexchange.com) chats, and alternative `\$` delimiters are automatically used for [Electrical Engineering](http://electronics.stackexchange.com) and [Code Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com).
* Instead of continually re-processing the whole page, ChatJax++ dynamically processes new chat messages as they arrive.  This should make ChatJax++ more responsive, and minimize its CPU load.  If you like, you can easily have dozens of chat tabs open at the same time, with ChatJax++ running in all of them.

Note that ChatJax++ is still under development.  Some issues to be fixed before v1.0 include:

* There is currently no way to manually enable or disable MathJax in a particular chat room (except by marking the room's URL as excluded in your user script manager).
* There's a possible race condition, where messages that you post yourself may sometimes not display MathJax correctly.  Unfortunately, reliably reproducing this issue seems tricky.  This *may* have been fixed by ChatJax++ v0.3, but I can't be 100% sure of it.

Users with [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome and other browsers) installed may [install this user script by clicking this link.](https://github.com/vyznev/chatjax/raw/master/ChatJax%2B%2B.user.js)

While ChatJax++ has currently only been tested on Firefox + Greasemonkey and Chrome + Tampermonkey, it will probably work on other similar browsers like Opera.  Compatibility with Microsoft Edge has not been tested, and there's a pretty good chance that something won't work.  If you can test it, please [let me know](https://github.com/vyznev/chatjax/issues) if it works or not.  When reporting issues, please try to include any diagnostic output (especially any lines starting with "ChatJax++ error") printed to the browser's Developer Tools console; this will make anylyzing and reproducing the issue much easier.

*[This modified version](https://github.com/EliahKagan/chatjax/raw/master/ChatJax%2B%2B.user.js) enables MathJax for chat rooms associated with Ask Ubuntu, by treating Ask Ubuntu as if it is Math Stack Exchange. It is tested only with Firefox + [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) but should work with other userscript managers.*
